## Usage
Click the X in the top-left corner to close the timer.

Click the gear icon in the top-right corner to view the settings, where you can edit the opacity of the timer, choose between the dark or light themes, and set your Minecraft directory.

The timer will appear frozen because due to how Minecraft stores its in-game time, it only updates when the game saves. It will update on autosaves, every time you open the pause menu, and when you go through the exit portal in the End.

If you don't use the default Minecraft directory, then you'll have to go into the timer's settings and set it to the directory that you do use.

If the timer doesn't update when you make a new world, then it's likely that you migrated your Minecraft directory, but the old one still exits and that's where the timer is reading from. Change your directory to the correct one in the timer's settings.

If you still experience issues or have any other questions, you can message me on Discord at NinjaSnail1080#8581 or [open an issue here](https://github.com/NinjaSnail1080/mc-universal-in-game-timer/issues).

That's about it. Good luck with your speedrun!
